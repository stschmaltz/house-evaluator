# House Evaluator

## Overview

A personal web app to speed up my home-buying process by automating commute and amenity checks for potential properties. I can enter a candidate home address, and the app automatically looks up driving and transit times at 8:00 AM from that address to a predefined set of destinations. It also finds nearby parks and grocery stores within a fixed radius.

The app saves results so I can revisit and compare multiple addresses easily, displaying everything in a clean dashboard with tables, a map, and amenity lists.
